Your code is well-structured, but there are a few potential issues and improvements to consider:

1. nodemailer.createTestAccount() is asynchronous
nodemailer.createTestAccount() is asynchronous and returns a promise. You are not awaiting it, which could cause issues when setting up the transporter.
Fix: Use await or handle the promise properly.
2. Environment variables validation
You are validating the presence of PORT, HOST, JWT_SECRET, and JWT_EXPIRATION, but you are not validating other critical variables like the email credentials for nodemailer (if used in production).
Fix: Add validation for all required environment variables.
3. Error handling for fs.readFileSync and fs.writeFileSync
If db.json is corrupted or inaccessible, fs.readFileSync or fs.writeFileSync could throw an error, crashing the server.
Fix: Wrap file operations in try-catch blocks.
4. bcrypt.hash error handling
You are checking if hashedPassword is falsy, but bcrypt.hash will throw an error if it fails, not return null or undefined.
Fix: Wrap bcrypt.hash in a try-catch block.
5. Token generation error handling
You are checking if token is falsy after jwt.sign, but jwt.sign will throw an error if it fails.
Fix: Wrap jwt.sign in a try-catch block.
6. nodemailer in production
You are using nodemailer.createTestAccount() for email sending, which is only for testing purposes. In production, you need to configure a real SMTP server.
Fix: Use environment variables for SMTP credentials in production.
7. Password hashing rounds
You are using bcrypt.hash(password, 10). While 10 is a reasonable default, you might want to make the number of rounds configurable via an environment variable for flexibility.
8. Potential race condition in read_db and write_db
If multiple requests modify the db.json file simultaneously, there could be a race condition.
Fix: Use a database (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB) instead of a JSON file for better concurrency handling.
9. verificationCodeExpires logic
You are setting verificationCodeExpires to Date.now() + 20 * 60 * 1000. This works, but it would be better to store it as an ISO string for consistency with createdAt.
Fix: Use new Date(Date.now() + 20 * 60 * 1000).toISOString().
10. Error messages leaking sensitive information
Some error messages (e.g., "Invalid or expired token") could give attackers hints about the system's behavior.
Fix: Use generic error messages like "Authentication failed" to avoid leaking information.
11. normalizeEmail and trim
You are normalizing and trimming the email and name multiple times. This is redundant and could be optimized.
Fix: Normalize and trim once, then reuse the processed values.
12. Hardcoded email sender
The sender email (MyApp <no-reply@myapp.com>) is hardcoded. This should be configurable via environment variables.
Fix: Use an environment variable for the sender email.
13. Missing HTTPS
Your server is running on HTTP (http://${HOST}:${PORT}), which is insecure for production.
Fix: Use HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate in production.
14. JWT expiration format
JWT_EXPIRATION is likely a string (e.g., "1h"), but you are not validating its format. If it's invalid, jwt.sign will throw an error.
Fix: Validate JWT_EXPIRATION format during startup.
15. Unused dotenv variables
You are loading environment variables with dotenv, but some variables (e.g., email credentials) are not used.
Fix: Remove unused variables or ensure they are used.
